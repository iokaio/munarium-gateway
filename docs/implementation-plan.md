# Munarium Gateway build plan

**Proposed work; no functional milestone is complete.** The design baseline is the
[public platform plan, revision 4](https://github.com/iokaio/munarium-platform/blob/main/docs/platform-plan.md), section 12, and its
stage sequence in section 25. Gateway's initial delivery belongs to **Stage 3**.
Calendar windows are planning targets; acceptance evidence controls advancement.

## Preparation present in this checkout

- A non-publishable, dependency-free Cargo library with documented interface modules.
- An [architecture map](architecture.md) naming ownership, trust assumptions and failures.
- An [acceptance specification](validation.md) and automatic Rust build checks.
- Existing contribution, security, support and repository-hygiene processes.

These artifacts prepare implementation; they do not complete Stage 0 foundation qualification
or advance this repository beyond the hub's **repository created** catalog state.

## First work packet: GATEWAY-01: document and test the Server extraction seam

**Prerequisites:** accepted hub decisions and the specific contracts named in
[Architecture](architecture.md); record the exact revisions used. All fixtures must be synthetic
or authorized public inputs. The hub [contract backlog](https://github.com/iokaio/munarium-platform/blob/main/docs/architecture/contract-backlog.md)
tracks unresolved cross-component definitions.

**Work:** Inspect a pinned public Server revision, identify provider/accounting modules and existing tests, and propose the S8 owner-maintained library/service boundary. Add compatibility fixtures in the owning codebase before extraction; this repository's ports remain unimplemented until that decision lands.

**Permitted scope:** the relevant modules under `src/`, component-local tests/fixtures,
and their documentation. Add dependencies, runtime wiring, or migrations only when the packet
requires them and its owner has reviewed the design. Do not copy sibling implementations.

**Acceptance:** A recorded before/after comparison shows unchanged Server behavior and a single accounting lineage. New monetary admission is explicitly separate work; no unsupported dollar-cap guarantee is introduced.

**Handoff:** retain commands, exit codes, fixture/contract revisions, limitations and the
diff for review. A test specification is not a passed test. Publishing, deployment, live
provider calls, signing changes and policy activation are separate operations.

## Subsequent packets

| Packet | Implementation scope | Exit condition |
|---|---|---|
| GATEWAY-02 | Add durable root-task reservations and settlement with corrections. | Concurrent parent/child requests cannot overspend the enforced bound; recording failure prevents dispatch. |
| GATEWAY-03 | Qualify one local and one hosted route with data-release controls. | Wrong endpoint, tenant, location, or classification is refused before sending prompt content. |
| GATEWAY-04 | Exercise streaming, cancellation, timeouts and incomplete usage. | Partial results and billable uncertainty retain invocation references and conservative accounting. |

Each packet gets a concrete component issue and links to the coordinating hub issue when
execution begins. The identifiers above are local planning references, not claims that remote
issues or approvals already exist. Work advances one coherent capability slice at a time.

## Integration and operational readiness

Before any runtime capability is advertised, document its supported contracts, immutable source
revision, accepted dependency versions and deployment boundary. Demonstrate relevant failure
paths from [Validation](validation.md), then add the component runbook: required identities,
health and dependency states, migration order, backup/restore, key rotation where applicable,
and unresolved-work investigation.

A component result alone is not platform qualification. The hub's
[delivery sequence](https://github.com/iokaio/munarium-platform/blob/main/docs/build-plan.md) requires composition evidence, including the
Server/Matrix foundation and the authority path required by the selected consequence class.
Broad provider coverage, duplicated provider API surfaces, and exact monetary guarantees unsupported by a provider contract.

## Completion criteria for the first functional increment

- The documented local recipe works from a clean clone using bounded disposable inputs.
- The acceptance cases are executable, retain their intended oracle, and include refusal paths.
- Unsupported operations remain explicit; logs and reports expose no credentials or private data.
- The README links the actual evidence before any capability or release label changes.
